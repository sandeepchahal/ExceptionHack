Cardiovascular Diseases
Acute Coronary Syndrome
■ Essentials of Diagnosis
• Classified as ST-segment elevation (Q wave) myocardial infarction (MI), non–ST-segment elevation (non-Q wave) MI, or unstable angina
• Prolonged (> 30 minutes) chest pain, associated with shortness of breath, nausea, left arm or neck pain, and diaphoresis; can be
painless in diabetics
• S4 common; S3, mitral insufficiency on occasion
• Cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias may complicate
• Unrelenting chest pain may mean ongoing jeopardized myocardium
■ Differential Diagnosis
• Stable angina; aortic dissection; pulmonary emboli
• Tietze’s syndrome (costochondritis)
• Cervical or thoracic radiculopathy, including pre-eruptive zoster
• Esophageal spasm or reflux; cholecystitis
• Pericarditis; myocarditis; Takotsubo’s (stress-induced) cardiomy-
opathy
• Pneumococcal pneumonia; pneumothorax
■ Treatment
• Monitoring, oxygen, aspirin, oral beta-blockers, and heparin if not contraindicated; consider clopidogrel
• Reperfusion by thrombolysis early or percutaneous coronary inter- vention (PCI) in selected patients with either ST-segment eleva- tion or new left bundle-branch block on ECG
• Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors considered for ST-segment ele- vation MI in patients undergoing PCI
• Nitroglycerin and morphine for recurrent ischemic pain; also useful for relieving pulmonary congestion, decreasing sympa- thetic tone, and reducing blood pressure
• Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and aldosterone blockers such as eplerenone improve ventricular remodeling after infarcts
■ Pearl
Proceed rapidly to reperfusion in ST-segment elevation MI as time
equals muscle.

Acute Pericarditis
Essentials of Diagnosis
• Inflammation of the pericardium due to viral infection, drugs, recent myocardial infarction, autoimmune syndromes, renal fail- ure, cardiac surgery, trauma, or neoplasm
• Common symptoms include pleuritic chest pain radiating to the shoulder (trapezius ridge) and dyspnea; pain improves with sit- ting up and expiration
• Examination may reveal fever, tachycardia, and an intermittent friction rub; cardiac tamponade may occur in any patient
• Electrocardiography usually shows PR depression, diffuse concave ST-segment elevation followed by T-wave inversions; no recip- rocal changes are seen
• Echocardiography may reveal pericardial effusion Differential Diagnosis
• Acute myocardial infarction
• Aortic dissection
• Pulmonary embolism
• Pneumothorax
• Pneumonia
• Cholecystitis and pancreatitis
Treatment
• Aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as ibupro- fen or indomethacin to relieve symptoms; colchicine has been shown to reduce recurrence; rarely, steroids for recurrent cases
• Hospitalization for patients with symptoms suggestive of signif- icant effusions, cardiac tamponade, elevated biomarkers, or recent trauma or surgery

Chapter 1 Cardiovascular Diseases 3 Acute Rheumatic Fever
■ Essentials of Diagnosis
• A systemic immune process complicating group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis
• Usually affects children between the ages of 5 and 15; rare after 25
• Occurs 1–5 weeks after throat infection
• Diagnosis based on Jones’ criteria (two major or one major and
two minor) and confirmation of recent streptococcal infection
• Major criteria: Erythema marginatum, migratory polyarthritis, subcutaneous nodules, carditis, and Sydenham’s chorea; the latter
is the most specific, least sensitive
• Minor criteria: Fever, arthralgias, elevated erythrocyte sedimen-
tation rate, elevated C-reactive protein, PR prolongation on ECG, and history of pharyngitis
■ Differential Diagnosis
• Juvenile or adult rheumatoid arthritis
• Endocarditis
• Osteomyelitis
• Systemic lupus erythematosus
• Lyme disease
• Disseminated gonococcal infection
■ Treatment
• Bed rest until vital signs and ECG become normal
• Salicylates and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce fever and joint complaints but do not affect the natural course of the dis-
ease; rarely, corticosteroids may be used
• If streptococcal infection is still present, penicillin is indicated
• Prevention of recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis until 18 years old
(a monthly injection of benzathine penicillin is most commonly used)
■ Pearl
Inappropriate tachycardia in a febrile child with a recent sore throat sug-
gests this diagnosis.

Angina Pectoris
Essentials of Diagnosis
• Generally caused by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and severe coronary obstruction; cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and family history are estab- lished risk factors
• Stable angina characterized by pressure-like episodic precordial chest discomfort, precipitated by exertion or stress, relieved by rest or nitrates; unstable angina can occur with less exertion or at rest
• Stable angina is predictable in initiation and termination; unstable angina is not
• S4, S3, mitral murmur, paradoxically split S2 may occur transiently with pain
• Electrocardiography usually normal between episodes (or may show evidence of old infarction); electrocardiography with pain may show evidence of ischemia, classically ST depression
• Diagnosis from history and stress tests; confirmed by coronary arteriography
Differential Diagnosis
• Other coronary syndromes (myocardial infarction, vasospasm)
• Tietze’s syndrome (costochondritis)
• Intercostal neuropathy, especially caused by herpes zoster
• Cervical or thoracic radiculopathy, including pre-eruptive zoster
• Esophageal spasm or reflux disease; cholecystitis
• Pneumothorax; pulmonary embolism; pneumonia Treatment
• Address risk factors; sublingual nitroglycerin for episodes
• Ongoing treatment includes aspirin, long-acting nitrates, beta-
blockers, and calcium channel blockers
• Angioplasty with stenting considered in patients with anatomically
suitable stenoses who remain symptomatic on medical therapy
• Bypass grafting for patients with refractory angina on medical therapy, three-vessel disease (or two-vessel disease with proximal left anterior descending artery disease) and decreased left ven-
tricular function, or left main coronary artery disease

Many patients with angina will not say they are having pain; they will deny it but say they have discomfort, heartburn, or pressure.

Chapter 1 Cardiovascular Diseases 5 Aortic Coarctation
■ Essentials of Diagnosis
• Elevated blood pressure in the aortic arch and its branches with reduced blood pressure distal to the left subclavian artery
• Lower extremity claudication or leg weakness with exertion in young adults is characteristic
• Systolic blood pressure is higher in the arms than in the legs, but diastolic pressure is similar compared with radial
• Femoral pulses delayed and decreased, with pulsatile collaterals in the intercostal areas; a harsh, late systolic murmur may be heard in the back; an aortic ejection murmur suggests concomi- tant bicuspid aortic valve
• Electrocardiography with left ventricular hypertrophy; chest x-ray may show rib notching inferiorly due to collaterals
• Transesophageal echo with Doppler or MRI is diagnostic; angiog- raphy confirms gradient across the coarctation
■ Differential Diagnosis
• Essential hypertension
• Renal artery stenosis
• Renal parenchymal disease
• Pheochromocytoma
• Mineralocorticoid excess
• Oral contraceptive use
• Cushing’s syndrome
■ Treatment
• Surgery is the mainstay of therapy; balloon angioplasty in selected patients
• Twenty-five percent of patients remain hypertensive after surgery ■ Pearl
Intermittent claudication in a young person with no vascular disease should suggest this problem; listen to the back for the characteristic murmur.

Aortic Dissection
Essentials of Diagnosis
• Most patients between age 50 and 70; risks include hypertension, Marfan’s syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta, and pregnancy
• Type A involves the ascending aorta or arch; type B does not
• Sudden onset of chest pain with interscapular radiation in at-risk
patient
• Unequal blood pressures in upper extremities, new diastolic
murmur of aortic insufficiency occasionally seen in type A
• Chest x-ray nearly always abnormal; ECG unimpressive unless
coronary artery compromised
• CT, transesophageal echocardiography, MRI, or aortography usu-
ally diagnostic
Differential Diagnosis
• Acute myocardial infarction
• Angina pectoris
• Acute pericarditis
• Pneumothorax
• Pulmonary embolism
• Boerhaave’s syndrome
Treatment
• Nitroprusside and beta-blockers to lower systolic blood pressure to approximately 100 mm Hg, pulse to 60/min
• Emergent surgery for type A dissection; medical therapy for type B is reasonable, with surgery or percutaneous intra-aortic stenting reserved for high-risk patients

The pain of dissection starts abruptly; that of ischemic heart disease increases to maximum over several minutes.

Chapter 1 Cardiovascular Diseases 7 Aortic Regurgitation
■ Essentials of Diagnosis
• Causes include congenital bicuspid valve, endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease, Marfan’s syndrome, aortic dissection, ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, and syphilis
• Acute aortic regurgitation: Abrupt onset of pulmonary edema
• Chronic aortic regurgitation: Asymptomatic until middle age,
when symptoms of left heart failure develop insidiously
• Soft, high-pitched, decrescendo holodiastolic murmur in chronic aortic regurgitation; occasionally, an accompanying apical low- pitched diastolic rumble (Austin Flint murmur) in nonrheumatic patients; in acute aortic regurgitation, the diastolic murmur can be
short (or not even heard) and harsh
• Acute aortic regurgitation: Reduced S1 and an S3; rales
• Chronic aortic regurgitation: Reduced S1, wide pulse pressure, water-
hammer pulse, subungual capillary pulsations (Quincke’s sign), rapid rise and fall of pulse (Corrigan’s pulse), and a diastolic murmur over a partially compressed femoral artery (Duroziez’s sign)
• ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy
• Echo Doppler confirms diagnosis, estimates severity
■ Differential Diagnosis
• Pulmonary hypertension with Graham Steell murmur
• Mitral, or rarely, tricuspid stenosis
• Left ventricular failure due to other cause
• Dock’s murmur of left anterior descending artery stenosis
■ Treatment
• Vasodilators (eg, nifedipine and ACE inhibitors) do not delay the progression to valve replacement in patients with mild to moder- ate aortic regurgitation
• In chronic aortic regurgitation, surgery reserved for patients with symptoms or ejection function < 50% on echocardiography
• Acute regurgitation caused by aortic dissection or endocarditis requires surgical replacement of the valve
■ Pearl
The Hodgkin-Key murmur of aortic regurgitation is harsh and raspy,
caused by leaflet eventration typical of luetic aortopathy.
